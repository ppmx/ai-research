# MNIST

Training a neural network based on the MNIST dataset. The numbers of
the keras dataset are white (1.0) and their backgrounds are black (0.0).

Gimp for example can be used to create such images: just select (28, 28)
as image size, mode must be grayscale and background is black while foreground
is white.
